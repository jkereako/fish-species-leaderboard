# Fish species leaderboard
Allows multiple users to compete head-to-head over the variety of species of
fish they can catch in a given time-frame.

This app, although functional, is an academic exercise. I use it as an example
of how to use the gems Devise and Pundit together as well as how to test them
with RSpec.
